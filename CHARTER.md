# The Open Source Security Foundation Charter
    As Amended 6 January 2022

1. Mission and Scope of the Open Source Security Foundation.

   a) The purpose of the Open Source Security Foundation (the “OpenSSF”) is to
inspire and enable the community to secure the open source software we all
depend on, including development, testing, fundraising, infrastructure, and
support initiatives driven by Working Groups (non- software focused) and
Projects (software focused), each a “Technical Initiative”. The governance of
each Technical Initiative will be as set forth in the applicable charter for
each Technical Initiative. Participation in Technical Initiatives will be open
to anyone, regardless of membership.

   b) The OpenSSF raises funds to support the Technical Initiatives. The OpenSSF
operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the OpenSSF (the
“Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with
The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.

   c) The Governing Board manages the OpenSSF. The OpenSSF will also have
Committees that may be established by the Governing Board. Committees report to
the Governing Board. Working Groups and Projects may be established under the
Technical Advisory Council (the “TAC”).

2. Membership.

   a) The OpenSSF will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members
(each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”, or, alternatively, “OpenSSF
Member” and “OpenSSF Members”, respectively) in Good Standing. All OpenSSF
Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to
participate in the OpenSSF as a OpenSSF Member. All participants in the OpenSSF
enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as
from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of the LF.
During the term of their membership, all OpenSSF Members will comply with all
such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the OpenSSF may adopt with
notice to members.

Governing Board and any Committee.

representative to the Governing Board for every ten General Members, up to a

one General Member representative, even if there are less than ten General
Members. The Governing Board determines the election process.

   d) The Associate Member category of OpenSSF Membership is limited to
Associate Members of The Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may establish
additional criteria for joining the OpenSSF as an Associate Member. If the

not put forth or vote on any motion.

    c) If the election of any of the TAC Representative, Associate Member
Representative, or Security Community Individual Representative would result in
